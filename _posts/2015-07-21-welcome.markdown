<p>At first, thank you for visit my blog and be interested on my work! If you don't know me or you don't know what I do... check <a href="../about">About</a> section</p>

<p>Now that you know something about me, it's time to present this new blog!!!</p>

<p>In this site I want to publish articles, tips and tutorials about some different technologies that I use everyday in my work. Some of that technologies will be <i>Spring, Spring Roo, gvNIX, OSGi, Maven</i>, etc... but maybe I will include some challenges related with other technologies.</p>

<p>If you have some question about this blog or about some published post, keep in touch with me using <a href="../contact">Contact</a> section.</p>

<p>I hope that you enjoy and learn with this new blog and you find what you were looking for.</p>
