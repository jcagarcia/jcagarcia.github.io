<p>Hello and thanks for visit my blog! My name is Juan Carlos Garc√≠a, I'm 23 years old and I'm from Torrent, Valencia (Spain).</p>

<p>Since I was a child, I've been passionate about computers and everything that surrounds them. When I was 14, I started to develop basic desktop applications using VB6 and basic web applications using PHP.</p>

<p>I studied Application Development at "Florida Universitaria" (Valencia, Spain). I worked at <a href="http://impartx.com/">ImpartX Ltd.</a> in Dublin (Ireland) with .NET technology and C #. Then I worked at <a href="http://www.axisdata.net/">Axis Data</a> in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) using Javascript technology.</p>

<p>Currently, I am Software Architect at <a href="http://www.disid.com">DiSiD Corporation, S.L</a> (Valencia, Spain), working on <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo">Spring Roo</a> project and <a href="http://www.gvnix.org">gvNIX</a> project using Java and Spring technology.</p>

<p>If you want to know something more about me and projects where I've worked, visit my <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/jcagarciadelcanto">Linkedin</a> profile</p>
